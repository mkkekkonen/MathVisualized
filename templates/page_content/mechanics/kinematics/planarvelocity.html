<p>
    Planar velocity deals with velocity on a 2D plane.
    There are multiple formulas related to this topic.
</p>

<p>
    You can move the "ship" by pressing the arrow keys.
</p>

<p>
    On this page, acceleration and speed are treated as
    scalars. The acceleration delta is added to the speed
    of the ship each frame. The velocity is calculated by
    multiplying the ship's direction unit vector with its speed. 
    The position delta is then calculated from velocity and time
    and added to the previous position.
</p>

<h3>The Position Vector</h3>

<p>
    The position vector of an object on a 2D plane is
    of the following form:
</p>

<p id="positionVector"></p>

<p>
    The <span id="i"></span> and <span id="j"></span>
    vectors are unit vectors pointing to the directions
    of the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes, respectively.
    The <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> values are scalars representing
    the object's distance from the origin.
</p>

<h3>Average Velocity</h3>

<p>
    Average velocity is calculated with the following 
    formula:
</p>

<p id="averageVelocity"></p>

<p>
    <span id="delta_t"></span> is the time during which
    the velocity is measured.
</p>

<h3>Speed</h3>

<p>
    Speed is a scalar quantity, i.e. it does not have a
    direction. It is the absolute value/"length" of the
    velocity vector.
</p>

<p>
    The formula for calculating speed is the following:
</p>

<p id="speed"></p>

<h3>Average Acceleration</h3>

<p>
    Average velocity during a time interval is calculated 
    by dividing the velocity vector with the time delta.
    The formula is the following:
</p>

<p id="averageAcceleration"></p>

<h3>Velocity and Acceleration at a Given Moment</h3>

<p>
    Velocity and acceleration at a given moment can be
    calculated with the preceding formulas, given 
    <span id="delta_t_2"></span> is small.
