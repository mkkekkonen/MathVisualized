<p>
    The distance between a line and a point is calculated here.
    The distance is the shortest one, and a line drawn along
    it is perpendicular to the original line.
</p>

<p>
    The distance is calculated with the formula below. The 
    equation is of the form <span id="equation"></span>, the
    point is <span id="point"></span>, and the distance is
    <span id="d"></span>.
</p>

<p id="formula"></p>

<p>
    There's a fixed line on the stage. You can set the point
    by clicking on the canvas.

    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
        katex.render(
            'd',
            document.getElementById('d'),
        );
        katex.render(
            'ax + by + c = 0',
            document.getElementById('equation'),
        );
        katex.render(
            '(x_0, y_0)',
            document.getElementById('point'),
        );
        katex.render(
            'd = \\frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + c|}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}',
            document.getElementById('formula'),
        );
    });
