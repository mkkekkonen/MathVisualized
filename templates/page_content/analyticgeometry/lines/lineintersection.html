<p>
    On this page line intersection is tested. There's
    one fixed line, and you can input the parameters of
    the other line manually.
</p>

<p>
    Line intersection is calculated by solving a
    system of equations containing both lines'
    equations. The result is the <i>x</i> and 
    <i>y</i> coordinates of the point where the lines
    intersect.
</p>

<p>
    Most often two lines have one point in common. There 
    are two special cases: if the lines are parallel,
    they have no common points, and if the lines are
    equal, they have an infinite number of points in
    common.
